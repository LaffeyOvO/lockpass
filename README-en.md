# A password manager

· English · [中文](./README.md)

## **background**

In the Internet era, there are too many account passwords. The previous method was to save them in a notepad. But it lacks security and is inconvenient to search.

There are many password management tools on the market, but they all require servers. But I always feel uneasy if sensitive information like passwords is stored on someone else's server.

I thought that the basic function is just encrypted storage and search, which should not be difficult to implement, so I made one by referring to 1password.

At present, the function is not perfect, and I will continue to optimize it during use. You can also give it a try and give me any suggestions.

My goals are currently simple:

1. Only for personal use, no sharing or collaboration is required.

2. No server is required, only network disk backup and recovery functions are provided. Control your own data

## **Principle Introduction**

1. A dual password mechanism similar to 1password: master password (remembered by the user) + key (the software generates a random password with a length of 25)

2. Confidential information uses the aes-256-cbc encryption algorithm. The key is sha256 (master password + key)

3. The data is stored locally and uses sqlite database.

## **Function introduction**

1. Confidential project support: account number, bank card, notes

2. Multiple confidential projects can be associated with one vault

3. Multiple account support

4. Random password generation tool

5. Automatically enter password function

6. Local backup and recovery function

7. Cloud disk backup and recovery function (currently only supports Alibaba cloud disk)

8. csv import (supports chrome and edge)

## **Development Notes**

### **Download Code**

```text
git clone https://github.com/ftyszyx/lockpass.git
```

### **Install dependencies**

```text
npm install
```

### **Run**

```text
npm rundev
```

## **Library used**

### **Pack**

[electron-vite](https://github.com/alex8088/electron-vite)

[electron-builder packaging](https://www.electron.build/index.html)

[electron-builder github](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder)
In fact, the packaging process is that electron vite first packages the script under main render preload into the out directory using vite, and then electron-build types the resources into asar.

## **Summary of problems encountered**

## **todo**

1. Program update mechanism (completed)
   https://www.electron.build/auto-update
   The function of electron-builder is indeed powerful and it is well done. Like it.

2. Linux packaging exception problem (completed)
   Snap packaging seems to require a signature file.
   For now, remove the snap.

```
snapcraft internal error: NoKeyringError('No keyring found to store or retrieve credentials from.')
```

4. Do not delete the configuration file during overwriting installation (completed)
   Previously, for the convenience of development, the user files and configurations generated by the program were placed in the current directory of the application.
   But the current mainstream approach is to put these configuration files in the user directory divided by the system.
   Under windows it is %appdata%
   In this case, there will be no above problems, because the configuration and program storage locations are separated.
   And there will be no permission issues.

5. Change master password (completed)

6. Switch language (completed)
   Support English and Chinese

7. Follow the system lock (completed)

8. Auto-start at boot (completed)
