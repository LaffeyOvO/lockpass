  // Place your lockpass workspace snippets here. Each snippet is defined under a snippet name and has a scope, prefix, body and
  // description. Add comma separated ids of the languages where the snippet is applicable in the scope field. If scope
  // is left empty or omitted, the snippet gets applied to all languages. The prefix is what is
  // used to trigger the snippet and the body will be expanded and inserted. Possible variables are:
  // $1, $2 for tab stops, $0 for the final cursor position, and ${1:label}, ${2:another} for placeholders.
  // Placeholders with the same ids are connected.
  // Example:
  "add copyright": {
    "scope": "javascript,typescript,typescriptreact,javascriptreact",
    "prefix": "add copyright",
    "body": [
      "/*",
      "desc: ${1:todo}",
      "Â© $CURRENT_YEAR ${2:zyx}",
      "date:$CURRENT_YEAR/$CURRENT_MONTH/$CURRENT_DATE $CURRENT_HOUR:$CURRENT_MINUTE:$CURRENT_SECOND",
      "*/"
    ],
    "description": "add copy right"
  }
}
